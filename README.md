# NASA Wrapper
![Logo](https://www.festisite.com/static/partylogo/img/logos/nasa.png)
Please refer to my [in-depth guide and introduction to these APIs](https://github.com/techtide/space-demos) before you begin using this.

This is how the plan is for the wrapper.
* ``data.py`` This will get the data from NASA and read through a configuration text file. It'll make it super easy to get started.
* ``brain.py`` Here's the brains behind the network. Quite simple. Just an image classifier.
* ``run.py`` This is the file which you run. It handles all of the runtime things and executes the pre-trained model for your project.
